Professional with collaborative and analytical profile, having just over a year of experience with Information Security and IT.
I am also graduating from the penultimate semester of IT Management Technologist and Information Security Analyst at Yaman, where I work for a client in the benefit sector/acquirer, managing vulnerabilities and CI/CD and Shift-Left processes for integrations with security tools (SAST/SCA/DAST) aligned to agile work frameworks and DevSecOps culture
In my spare time, I dedicate myself to other areas of personal and career interest such as Cloud, Ethical Hacking and IT Governance & Management.
